## Introduction

This project aims to predict stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. LSTM models are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for their ability to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data.

## Project Overview

### Data Collection

Collect historical stock price data for the target stock. In this example, we'll use Microsoft stock price data from January 2023 to July 2023. You can use data sources like Yahoo Finance or APIs to obtain the necessary data.

### Data Preprocessing

1. Split the collected data into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to train the LSTM model, while the test set will be used to evaluate its accuracy.
2. Normalize the data using techniques like Min-Max scaling to bring the values within a common range. Normalization is crucial to ensure that the model learns patterns effectively.

### Model Creation

1. Design and create an LSTM model architecture. The architecture can include multiple LSTM layers, dropout layers, and dense layers. The complexity of the model depends on factors such as the data's complexity and the desired prediction accuracy.
2. Train the LSTM model on the training set using the normalized data. During training, the model learns the underlying trends and patterns in the data.

## Usage

1. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (`Stock_Price_Prediction_LSTM.ipynb`) to follow the step-by-step implementation.
2. The notebook guides you through data loading, preprocessing, model creation, training, evaluation, and prediction.
3. Code cells are included throughout the notebook to demonstrate each step using Python code and explanations.

## Results

The performance of the LSTM model is evaluated on the test set. Common evaluation metrics include Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics measure the model's accuracy in predicting stock prices.
